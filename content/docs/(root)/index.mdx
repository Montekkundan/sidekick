**Sidekick** is a collection of AI-focused UI components designed for building chat interfaces and conversational experiences.

## What's Included

- **Sidekick**: A collapsible AI chat sidebar with conversation history and message bubbles
- **PromptInput**: An advanced input component with file attachments and speech support
- **Themes**: Customizable themes like the Cursor-inspired dark theme

## Installation

Pick the components you need and add them to your project using the CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://sidekick.montek.dev/r/sidekick.json
```

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://sidekick.montek.dev/r/prompt-input.json
```

Or copy and paste the code directly into your project.

## Themes

Sidekick supports theming. Apply themes by adding a class to your root element:

```bash
# Install the Cursor theme
npx shadcn@latest add https://sidekick.montek.dev/r/theme-cursor.json
```

Then apply it:

```tsx
<SidekickProvider className="theme-cursor">
  {/* Your components */}
</SidekickProvider>
```

## Principles

Built around the following principles from [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com):

- **Open Code**: The top layer of your component code is open for modification
- **Composition**: Every component uses a common, composable interface
- **Distribution**: A flat-file schema and CLI make it easy to distribute
- **Beautiful Defaults**: Carefully chosen default styles out-of-the-box
- **AI-Ready**: Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve

## Customization

All components are fully customizable:

```tsx
// Position the sidekick on the left
<Sidekick side="left">
  {/* ... */}
</Sidekick>

// Control the sidekick state
<SidekickProvider defaultOpen={false} onOpenChange={(open) => console.log(open)}>
  {/* ... */}
</SidekickProvider>
```

## Open Source

All components are open source. The code is yours to customize and extend to fit your needs.
