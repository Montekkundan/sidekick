description: Power your Fumadocs site with Basehub content.

## Overview

This cookbook shows how to pair Fumadocs with Basehub so your docs content lives in a CMS while keeping the same MDX component system.

## Ingredients

- Fumadocs (routing + layout)
- Basehub account + docs schema
- Content loader that maps Basehub entries to routes

## Steps

1. Model your docs in Basehub (title, slug, description, body).
2. Build a loader that fetches entries and returns MDX-ready content.
3. Map Basehub slugs to Fumadocs routes.
4. Reuse the same MDX components for consistency.

## Suggested Content Model

- `Doc` collection
  - `title` (string)
  - `slug` (string)
  - `description` (string)
  - `body` (rich text / MDX)

## Tips

- Cache Basehub responses at the edge for fast navigation.
- Keep slugs aligned with your on-disk routes for easy migration.
