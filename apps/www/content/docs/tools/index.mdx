description: AI SDK tools to enhance your AI applications with powerful capabilities.

We build on [AI SDK Tool Registry](https://ai-sdk.dev/tools-registry) and provide a set of pre-built tools to enhance your AI applications. Tools allow your AI models to interact with external systems, APIs, and perform complex tasks.

## Available Tools

TODO add list of available tools here

## What are AI SDK Tools?

Tools are functions that can be called by AI models during a conversation. They enable AI to:

- **Access Real-Time Data**: Fetch current information from APIs and databases
- **Perform Actions**: Execute tasks like navigation, search, or data manipulation
- **Extend Capabilities**: Add custom functionality specific to your application

## Using Tools with AI SDK

```tsx
import { generateText, gateway } from "ai";
import { navigationTool } from "ai-navigation-tool";

const result = await generateText({
  model: gateway("openai/gpt-4o-mini"),
  prompt: "Where can I find the documentation?",
  tools: {
    navigate: navigationTool({ schema }),
  },
});
```

## Building Custom Tools

All tools follow the AI SDK tool pattern:

```tsx
import { tool } from "ai";
import { z } from "zod";

export const myTool = tool({
  description: "Description for the AI model",
  parameters: z.object({
    input: z.string().describe("What this parameter is for"),
  }),
  execute: async ({ input }) => {
    // Your tool logic
    return { result: "..." };
  },
});
```
